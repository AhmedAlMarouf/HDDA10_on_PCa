Needle Biopsy Data Cleaning:

For needle biopsy samples, that field can be found as surgical_biopsy_number or bx_uid, whereas for the radical prostatectomy samples 
the field name is either Prostatectomy Surgical # or surgical_rp_number. The metadata file 210318_UCalgary_AllInfo.xlsx contained the 
Bx or RP ID numbers under the specimen column. At this point it is important to mention that due to the changes in personnel and the 
passing of a significant amount of time since the relevant study was completed, not every piece of information could be thoroughly explained 
by the institution that curated the data. In many cases, the values in the specimen column would follow the format SR-XX-YYYY-ZZ/JJJ. 
The suffix JJJ looked similar to the IHC block information, which is why, when available, it populated a new column named block identifier in
the file uofc_complete_decipher_file_final.csv (the resulting file of the preprocessing). The ZZ part was discarded due to lack of further information.
After utilizing all pairs of Bx-RP numbers (eventually each patient should be matched to a pair of IDs, one of each kind), 399 out of 404 total samples were matched. 
The biopsy samples that lack matching RP samples are the ones with IDs “SR-01-1311” and “SR-07-10477” (3 + 2 biopsy samples respectively, due to multiplicity). 
The code used for this can be found in the "data_cleanup.R" file.
